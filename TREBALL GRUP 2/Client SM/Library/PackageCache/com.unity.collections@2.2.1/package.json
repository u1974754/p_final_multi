Sort will now no longer access invalid memory and when running with collection checks enabled (e.g. always on in Editor) or using `UNITY_DOTS_DEBUG` in player builds, an additional check at the beginning of the sort will validate the comparer is implemented correctly and inform users otherwise.\n\n### Added\n\n* Added a dependency on the com.unity.test-framework.performance package"
